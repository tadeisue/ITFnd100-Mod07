# Introduction #
### While learning to use Python, formatting the code with specific #
### space and text determines how the preview of the final Assignment/Module document will run. #
### #
### Assignment Number 7, within Module 7, is to use script code that uses pickling and structured error handling. #
### The Assignment 07 Starter.py code is helpful to view where the additional code needs to be added, which is in the Presentation section of the script.# 
### Also, we were to create a new Assignment 07 GitHub webpage to understand how GitHub can be a source account for  uploading, reviewing, editing, and finalizing code within the assignment document file. #
### This portion of the Assignment is to become familiar with formatting in GitHub to create a document similar to the Word Assignment documents that we, as students, have been creating for each weekly assigned Module. The GitHub web page is for other students to review the code and comment on each otherâ€™s GitHub repositories.![image](https://github.com/tadeisue/ITFnd100-Mod07/assets/131211225/a091b16b-94b2-4497-84d8-1168e4420f5b)

## Topic 1 #

### For the pickling code, I used the example of how pickling works from the module 7 assignment example #
### I researched Pickling on the Internet and the website https://realpython.com/python-pickle-module/ gives a real good example of how the pickling code works. #
### For the pickling code, I used the example code from the assignment Word document and the RealPython website to do a short version of code to make it run. #
### I tend to try to do more with understanding the starter code and working through Professor Root's example, but it is more advanced than what I feel I am ready for, so I'm using smaller code examples until I have a more solid grasp of the coding language commands. #
### Here are the images for the pickling codes.

## Topic 2 #

### With Structured Error Handling, I used the example code from the Word assignment document, so that I can understand how the code works, and how to insert the code to make it run. #
### I have been struggling with getting the correct indentations and I seem to be having syntax errors when I type in the code, so I'm working in smaller example code until I can have more experience with using the starter code to apply the correct data, processing, and presentation code to have the program run correctly. #

# Summary #
### I am late turning in Module 7 Assignment because I was in Oregon until late Tuesday, May 30, 2023, and I need to understand the programming process of coding in smaller baby steps, than trying to insert all the data, processing, and presentation code, for hours, only to have the code not run. #
### I have been completing the Labs for the Module Assignments, and the labs are helpful, as they are a smaller chunk of the learnin process. With strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, global and local variables, try/except block, else if statements, there is much to learn, so taking it slowly is a better learning process for me. #               ### Reading the chapters and using the RealPython.com website is very helpful. #

# Making a change to monitor GitHub Website to see if the change (inserted this text) is made.#
